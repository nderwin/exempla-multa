= Multiple Examples

== Setup

The `docker` folder contains a `docker-compose.yml` file that is used to stand up various dependencies that the
applications will need, such as a database, a message queue, etc.  Execute

```
docker compose up
```

in this directory before starting any of the other applications.

=== Java Setup

Java 8 is required for the `telemetry-with-javaee` project.  Java 21 is the minimum for other projects.

== Telemetry

The `telemetry-with-quarkus` and `telemetry-with-javaee` projects demonstrate how Telemetry can be used to show the flow
of data from one application, through a message broker, to another application.  The traces and spans that are generated
can illustrate what code is being called at what point in the lifecycle of an application function.
